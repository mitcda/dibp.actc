# Australian Customs Tariff Classification

## Introduction

The Combined Australian Customs Tariff Nomenclature and Statistical
Classification (commonly known as the Working Tariff) incorporates the *Customs
Tariff Act 1995* (Act No. 147 of 1995), as amended or proposed to be altered
from time to time, and the Australian Harmonized Statistical Classification.
 
The Australian Customs Tariff Classification working document is designed for
day to day use in determining tariff classifications and rates of Customs duty,
etc., for the purposes of entry of imported goods into Australia.

The Australian Customs Tariff Classification is based on the International
Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (HS) to
which Australia is a signatory.  The Convention provides the Interpretation
Rules (set out in Schedule 2), Sections, Chapters, headings, five and six digit
subheadings and Notes to Sections and Chapters are contained in Schedule 3 of
the
[Combined Australian Customs Tariff Nomenclature and Statistical Classification](https://www.border.gov.au/Tariffclassificationofgoods/Documents/httitlgwv2.pdf).
  
This dataset is based on the online version of Schedule 3 of the Department of
Immigration and Border Protection document
titled
[Combined Australian Customs Tariff Nomenclature and Statistical Classification](https://www.border.gov.au/Busi/cargo-support-trade-and-goods/importing-goods/tariff-classification-of-goods/current-tariff-classification/schedule-3).

This version of the Working Tariff contains the tariff changes resulting from
the World Customs Organization fourth review of the International Convention on
the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, commonly referred to as
the Harmonized System.  It also contains the consequential changes to the
statistical codes in Schedule 3 and the statistical code changes made by the
Australian Bureau of Statistics as a result of its review of the Statistical
codes in Schedule 3 of the Tariff. The changes contained in the new Working
Tariff commenced on 1 January 2017.
