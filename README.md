# Combined Australian Customs Tariff Nomenclature and Statistical Classification

## Introduction

The Combined Australian Customs Tariff Nomenclature and Statistical
Classification (referred to here as the Australian Customs Tariff Classification) is designed
for use by exporters, customs brokers and freight forwarders in the
classification of goods when providing export declarations to the Department of
Immigration and Border Protection, and to assist users interpret export
statistics published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) (See: \url{http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/1233.0Explanatory Notes}).

The classification is based on the six digit international Harmonized Commodity
Description and Coding System (HS) developed by the World Customs Organization
(WCO) for describing internationally traded goods. The ABS extends the six digit
international HS by two digits to provide a finer level of detail to meet
Australian statistical requirements (Statistical codes).

The most significant changes to the AHECC occur when the WCO periodically
updates the international HS. The international HS and the AHECC have been
updated in 1992, 1996, 2002, 2007 and 2012. This update incorporates the 2017
international HS changes and associated AHECC changes. The next international
update is scheduled for 2022.

Further details can be obtained from the ABS website: [Australian Harmonized Export Commodity Classification (AHECC)](http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/1233.0).
